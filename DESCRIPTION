Description: scRepertoire was built to process data derived from the 10x Genomics Chromium Immune Profiling for both T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) enrichment workflows and subsequently interacts with the popular Seurat and SingleCellExperiment R packages. It also allows for general analysis of single-cell clonotype information without the use of expression information. The package functions as a wrapper for Startrac and powerTCR R packages.
