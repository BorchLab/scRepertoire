CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4
------------------------
* Modification in clusterTCR() and combineBCR() to speed up the comparison and use less memory
* FilteringMulti, now isolates the top contig by chain, then for barcodes with chains > 2, isolates the top expressing chains. This substantially increases the speed of the filtering step. 
* Modified makeGenes() internal function to use strings str_c()
* Added threshold parameter to combineTRUST4 for B cell manipulation 
* Changed combineTCR function to prevent cell type mix up and clarified in function documentation.
* vizGenes can now be used to look at other component genes of the receptor and "separate" parameter was replaced by "y.axis" parameter.
* Added clonotypeBias() function for inter-cluster comparison.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------
* CombineBCR() auto naming function updated to actually name the list elements. 
* Added createHTOContigList() function to create contain list of multiplexed experiments. Fixed issue with groupBy variable
* Added Inv.Pielou matric to diversity call - this is essentially 1-shannon/ln(length). Due to the bootstrapping the length with be constant.
* Added include.na and split.by to occupiedscRepertoire and changed labeling depending on frequency vs proportion
* Added support for single-cell objects for most visualizations, list organizing by single-cell object can be called using split.by variable
* All group and groupBy parameters are now group.by.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
------------------------
# This is the new numbering scheme apologies - we are all up-to-date now and now cell ranger >= 5 will # work on bioconductor, so let's all just take that as a win.

* added dot.size parameter to scatterClonotype
* filteringMulti now subsets clonotypes with contains >=2, to prevent 2 of the same chains
* changed how coldata is added to SCE objects using merge instead of union
* Can now add BCR and TCR simultaneously by making large list
* scatter plotting code is not so ugly and allows for user to select dot.size as a variable on the x or y axis
* Removed regressClonotype function - too many dependencies required, adding an additional vignette to go through the process
* Added chain option to visualizations and combineExpression to allow users to facilitate single chains - removed chain option from combineTCR/BCR/TRUST4 (the combined object will have both chains no matter what)
* Added NA filter to combineTCR/BCR/TRUST4 for cell barcodes with only NA values
* Added NA filter to expression2List() for cells with NA clonotypes.
* Updated VizGene to order the genes automatically by highest to lowest variance
* Updated VizGene to pull the correct genes based on selection
* Updated parse method - old version had issue with place V-->J-->D in the TRB/Heavy chains 
* Simplified the clonalDiversity() to allow for more options in organizing plot and box plots. 
* CombineExpression() adds the groupBy variable to Frequency, allowing for multiple calculations to be saved in the meta data. 
* Default color scheme now uses viridis plasma, because it I am on transfusion medicine.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.2
------------------------

# Working on renumbering versions for consistency - this is the new current dev branch
# The below have not been implemented into the master branch or the bioconductor version

* added the combineTRUST4 function to parse contigs from TUST4 pipeline
* added the filter of contigs by chain in the combineTCR, combineBCR, and combineTRUST4 functions
* no longer require the ID in the combineTCR/BCR/TRUST4 functions
* added jaccard index for overlap analysis
* replaced vizVgene with vizGene - allowing users to look at any gene in the combinedContig object
* Fixed coloring scale on the overlap analysis
* Added regressClonotype function using harmony to remove the clonotype effect on feature space
* allowed occupiedRepertoire to use proportion.
* added scatterClonotype function to Viz.R

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
------------------------

* number of changes to the parseTCR/BCR functions to limit assumptions
* Changed grabMeta to include assessment of colnames
* fixed lengthDF handling of single chains with multi chains stored - ;
* Added labels to alluvialClonotype and occupiedClonotype plotting

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4
------------------------

* replaced hammingCompare with lvCompare to enable superior clonotype calling in combineBCR function.
* added proportion to combineExpression() function so users no longer need to know absolute frequencies when combining the contiguous information. 
* added clusterTCR() and clonalOverlay() functions.
* added downsampling to the diversity calculations
* replaced hammingCompare with lvCompare to enable superior clonotype calling in combineBCR function.
* added proportion to combineExpression() function so users no longer need to know absolute frequencies when combining the contiguous information. 
* added clusterTCR() and clonalOverlay() functions.
* added downsampling to the diversity calculations
* Clonal Overlap Coefficient issue fixed, was comparing unique barcodes and not clonotypes
* Added function checkBlanks to remove list elements without clonotypes, this prevents errors for visualizations
* Re-added Startrac metrics by stripping down the package and adding it piecemeal
* Heavily modified dependencies to reduce total number
