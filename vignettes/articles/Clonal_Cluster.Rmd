## clonalCluster: Cluster by Sequence Similarity

The `clonalCluster()` function provides a powerful method to group clonotypes based on sequence similarity. It calculates the edit distance between CDR3 sequences and uses this information to build a network, identifying closely related clusters of T or B cell receptors. This functionality allows for a more nuanced definition of a "clone" that extends beyond identical sequence matches.

### Core Concepts

The clustering process follows these key steps:

* **Sequence Selection**: The function selects either the nucleotide (`sequence = "nt"`) or amino acid (`sequence = "aa"`) CDR3 sequences for a specified chain.
* **Distance Calculation**: It calculates the edit distance between all pairs of sequences. By default, it also requires sequences to share the same V gene (`use.v = TRUE`).
* **Network Construction**: An edge is created between any two sequences that meet the similarity threshold, forming a network graph.
* **Clustering**: A graph-based clustering algorithm is run to identify connected components or communities within the network. By default, it identifies all directly or indirectly connected sequences as a single cluster (`cluster.method = "components"`).
* **Output**: The function can either add the resulting cluster IDs to the input object, return an `igraph` object for network analysis, or export a sparse adjacency matrix.

### Understanding the `threshold` Parameter

The behavior of the threshold parameter is critical for controlling cluster granularity:

* **Normalized Similarity (threshold < 1)**: When the threshold is a value between 0 and 1 (e.g., `0.85`), it represents the normalized edit distance (Levenshtein distance / mean sequence length). A higher value corresponds to a stricter similarity requirement. This is useful for comparing sequences of varying lengths.
* **Raw Edit Distance (threshold >= 1)**: When the threshold is a whole number (e.g., 2), it represents the maximum raw edit distance allowed. A lower value corresponds to a stricter similarity requirement. This is useful when you want to allow a specific number of mutations.

Key Parameter(s) for ```clonalCluster()```

* `sequence`: Specifies whether to cluster based on `aa` (amino acid) or `nt` (nucleotide) sequences.
* `threshold`: The similarity threshold for clustering. Values `< 1` are normalized similarity, while values `>= 1` are raw edit distance.
* `group.by`: A column header in the metadata or lists to group the analysis by (e.g., "sample", "treatment"). If `NULL`, clusters are calculated across all sequences.
* `use.V`: If `TRUE`, sequences must share the same V gene to be clustered together.
* `use.J`: If `TRUE`, sequences must share the same J gene to be clustered together.
* `cluster.method`: The clustering algorithm to use. Defaults to `components`, which finds connected subgraphs.
* `cluster.prefix`: A character prefix to add to the cluster names (e.g., "cluster.").
* `exportGraph`: If `TRUE`, returns an igraph object of the sequence network.
* `exportAdjMatrix`: If `TRUE`, returns a sparse adjacency matrix (dgCMatrix) of the network.

### Demonstrating Basic Use

To run clustering on the first two samples for the TRA chain, using amino acid sequences with a normalized similarity threshold of 0.85:

```{r tidy = FALSE}
# Run clustering on the first two samples for the TRA chain
sub_combined <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)], 
                              chain = "TRA", 
                              sequence = "aa", 
                              threshold = 0.85)

# View the new cluster column
head(sub_combined[[1]][, c("barcode", "TCR1", "TRA.Cluster")])
```

### Demonstrating Clustering with a Single-Cell Object

You can calculate clusters based on specific metadata variables within a single-cell object by using the `group.by` parameter. This is useful for analyzing clusters on a per-sample or per-patient basis without subsetting the data first.

First, add patient and type information to the `scRep_example` Seurat object:

```{r tidy = FALSE}
#Adding patient information
scRep_example$Patient <- substr(scRep_example$orig.ident, 1,3)

#Adding type information
scRep_example$Type <- substr(scRep_example$orig.ident, 4,4)
```

Now, run clustering on the `scRep_example` Seurat object, grouping calculations by "Patient":

```{r}
# Run clustering, but group calculations by "Patient"
scRep_example <- clonalCluster(scRep_example, 
                               chain = "TRA", 
                               sequence = "aa", 
                               threshold = 0.85, 
                               group.by = "Patient")

#Define color palette 
num_clusters <- length(unique(na.omit(scRep_example$TRA.Cluster)))
cluster_colors <- hcl.colors(n = num_clusters, palette = "inferno")

DimPlot(scRep_example, group.by = "TRA.Cluster") +
  scale_color_manual(values = cluster_colors, na.value = "grey") + 
  NoLegend()
```

### Returning an igraph Object:

Instead of modifying the input object, ```clonalCluster()``` can export the underlying network structure for advanced analysis. Set `exportGraph = TRUE` to get an igraph object consisting of the networks of barcodes by the indicated clustering scheme. 

```{r tidy = FALSE}
set.seed(42)
#Clustering Patient 19 samples
igraph.object <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(5,6)],
                               chain = "TRB",
                               sequence = "aa",
                               group.by = "sample",
                               threshold = 0.85, 
                               exportGraph = TRUE)

# Setting color scheme
col_legend <- factor(igraph::V(igraph.object)$group)
col_samples <- hcl.colors(2,"inferno")[as.numeric(col_legend)]
color.legend <- factor(unique(igraph::V(igraph.object)$group))

# Sampling 1000 Barcodes
sample.vertices <- V(igraph.object)[sample(length(igraph.object), 1000)]
subgraph.object <- induced_subgraph(igraph.object, vids = sample.vertices)
V(subgraph.object)$degrees <- igraph::degree(subgraph.object)
edge_alpha_color <- adjustcolor("gray", alpha.f = 0.3)

#Plotting
plot(subgraph.object,
     layout = layout_nicely(subgraph.object),
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = sqrt(igraph::V(subgraph.object)$degrees), 
     vertex.color = col_samples[sample.vertices],
     vertex.frame.color = "white", 
     edge.color = edge_alpha_color,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.05,
     edge.curved = 0.05, 
     margin = -0.1)
legend("topleft", 
       legend = levels(color.legend), 
       pch = 16, 
       col = unique(col_samples), 
       bty = "n")
```

### Returning a Sparse Adjacency Matrix

For computational applications, you can export a sparse adjacency matrix using `exportAdjMatrix = TRUE`. This matrix represents the connections between all barcodes in the input data, with the edit distance that meet the threshold in places of connection.

```{r}
# Generate the sparse matrix
adj.matrix <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)],
                            chain = "TRB",
                            exportAdjMatrix = TRUE)

# View the dimensions and a snippet of the matrix
dim(adj.matrix)
print(adj.matrix[1:10, 1:10])
```

### Using Both Chains

You can analyze the combined network of both TRA/TRB or IGH/IGL chains by setting `chain = "both"`. This will create a single cluster column named `Multi.Cluster`.

```{r}
# Cluster using both TRB and TRA chains simultaneously
clustered_both <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)], 
                                chain = "both")

# View the new "Multi.Cluster" column
head(clustered_both[[1]][, c("barcode", "TCR1", "TCR2", "Multi.Cluster")])
```

### Using Different Clustering Algorithms

While the default `cluster.method = "components"` is robust, you can use other algorithms from the igraph package, such as `walktrap` or `louvain`, to potentially uncover different community structures.

```{r}
# Cluster using the walktrap algorithm
graph_walktrap <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)],
                                cluster.method = "walktrap",
                                exportGraph = TRUE)

# Compare the number of clusters found
length(unique(V(graph_walktrap)$cluster))

```

Overall, `clonalCluster()` is a versatile function for defining and analyzing clonal relationships based on sequence similarity. It allows researchers to move beyond exact sequence matches, providing a more comprehensive understanding of clonal families. The ability to customize parameters like `threshold`, `chain` selection, and `group.by` ensures adaptability to diverse research questions. Furthermore, the option to export `igraph` objects or sparse adjacency matrices provides advanced users with the tools for in-depth network analysis.
