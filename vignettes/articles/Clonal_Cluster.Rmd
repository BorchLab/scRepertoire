## clonalCluster

The ```clonalCluster()``` function provides a powerful method to group clonotypes based on sequence similarity. It calculates the edit distance between CDR3 sequences and uses this information to build a network, identifying closely related clusters of T or B cell receptors. This functionality allows for a more nuanced definition of a "clone" that extends beyond identical sequence matches.

### Core Concepts

The clustering process follows these key steps:

* **Sequence Selection**: The function selects either the nucleotide (`sequence = "nt"`) or amino acid (`sequence = "aa"`) CDR3 sequences for a specified chain.
* **Distance Calculation**: It calculates the edit distance between all pairs of sequences. By default, it also requires sequences to share the same V gene (`use.v = TRUE`).
* **Network Construction**: An edge is created between any two sequences that meet the similarity threshold, forming a network graph.
* **Clustering**: A graph-based clustering algorithm is run to identify connected components or communities within the network. By default, it identifies all directly or indirectly connected sequences as a single cluster (cluster.method = "components").
* **Output**: The function can either add the resulting cluster IDs to the input object, return an `igraph` object for network analysis, or export a sparse adjacency matrix.

### Understanding the threshold Parameter

The behavior of the threshold parameter is critical for controlling cluster granularity:

* **Normalized Similarity (threshold < 1)**: When the threshold is a value between 0 and 1 (e.g., `0.85`), it represents the normalized edit distance (Levenshtein distance / mean sequence length). A higher value corresponds to a stricter similarity requirement. This is useful for comparing sequences of varying lengths.
* **Raw Edit Distance (threshold >= 1)**: When the threshold is a whole number (e.g., 2), it represents the maximum raw edit distance allowed. A lower value corresponds to a stricter similarity requirement. This is useful when you want to allow a specific number of mutations.

### Basic use

```{r tidy = FALSE}
# Run clustering on the first two samples for the TRA chain
sub_combined <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)], 
                              chain = "TRA", 
                              sequence = "aa", 
                              threshold = 0.85)

# View the new cluster column
head(sub_combined[[1]][, c("barcode", "TCR1", "TRA.Cluster")])
```

### Clustering with a single-cell object

If performed over the number of samples, such as the list elements, **group.by** can used to calculate only the clusters on the setting of patient sample (**group.by** = "Patient") or tissue type (**group.by** = "Type"). This is useful for analyzing clusters on a per-sample or per-patient basis without subsetting the data first.

```{r tidy = FALSE}
#Adding patient information
scRep_example$Patient <- substr(scRep_example$orig.ident, 1,3)

#Adding type information
scRep_example$Type <- substr(scRep_example$orig.ident, 4,4)



# Run clustering, but group calculations by "Patient"
scRep_example <- clonalCluster(scRep_example, 
                               chain = "TRA", 
                               sequence = "aa", 
                               threshold = 0.85, 
                               group.by = "Patient")

#Define color palette 
num_clusters <- length(unique(na.omit(scRep_example$TRA.Cluster)))
cluster_colors <- hcl.colors(n = num_clusters, palette = "inferno")

DimPlot(scRep_example, group.by = "TRA.Cluster") +
  scale_color_manual(values = cluster_colors, na.value = "grey") + 
  NoLegend()
```

Instead of modifying the input object, ```clonalCluster()``` can export the underlying network structure for advanced analysis. 

### Returning an igraph object:

Set `exportGraph = TRUE` to get an igraph object consisting of the networks of barcodes by the indicated clustering scheme. 

```{r tidy = FALSE}
set.seed(42)
#Clustering Patient 19 samples
igraph.object <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(5,6)],
                               chain = "TRB",
                               sequence = "aa",
                               group.by = "sample",
                               threshold = 0.85, 
                               exportGraph = TRUE)

#Setting color scheme
col_legend <- factor(igraph::V(igraph.object)$group)
col_samples <- hcl.colors(2,"inferno")[as.numeric(col_legend)]
color.legend <- factor(unique(igraph::V(igraph.object)$group))
sample.vertices <- V(igraph.object)[sample(length(igraph.object), 500)]

subgraph.object <- induced_subgraph(igraph.object, vids = sample.vertices)
V(subgraph.object)$degrees <- igraph::degree(subgraph.object)
edge_alpha_color <- adjustcolor("gray", alpha.f = 0.3)

#Plotting
plot(subgraph.object,
     layout = layout_nicely(subgraph.object),
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = sqrt(igraph::V(subgraph.object)$degrees), 
     vertex.color = col_samples[sample.vertices],
     vertex.frame.color = "white", 
     edge.color = edge_alpha_color,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.05,
     edge.curved = 0.05, 
     margin = -0.1)
legend("topleft", 
       legend = levels(color.legend), 
       pch = 16, 
       col = unique(col_samples), 
       bty = "n")
```

### Returning a Sparse Adjacency Matrix

For computational applications, you can export a sparse adjacency matrix using `exportAdjMatrix = TRUE`. This matrix represents the connections between all barcodes in the input data, with the edit distance that meet the threshold in places of connection.

```{r}
# Generate the sparse matrix
adj.matrix <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)],
                            chain = "TRB",
                            exportAdjMatrix = TRUE)

# View the dimensions and a snippet of the matrix
dim(adj.matrix)
print(adj.matrix[1:10, 1:10])
```

### Using Both Chains

You can analyze the combined network of both TRA/TRB or IGH/IGL chains by setting chain = "both". This will create a single cluster column named Multi_Cluster.

```{r}
# Cluster using both TRB and TRA chains simultaneously
clustered_both <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)], 
                                chain = "both")

# View the new "Multi.Cluster" column
head(clustered_both[[1]][, c("barcode", "TCR1", "TCR2", "Multi.Cluster")])
```

### Using Different Clustering Algorithms

While the default `cluster.method = "components"` is robust, you can use other algorithms from the igraph package, such as `walktrap` or `louvain`, to potentially uncover different community structures.

```{r}
# Cluster using the walktrap algorithm
graph_walktrap <- clonalCluster(combined.TCR[c(1,2)],
                                cluster.method = "walktrap",
                                exportGraph = TRUE)

# Compare the number of clusters found
length(unique(V(graph_walktrap)$cluster))

```
