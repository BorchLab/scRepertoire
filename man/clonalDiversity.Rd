\title{Examine the clonal diversity of samples}
\usage{
clonalDiversity(
  df,
  cloneCall = c("gene", "nt", "aa", "gene+nt"),
  group = c("samples"),
  exportTable = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The product of CombineContig() or expression2List().}

\item{cloneCall}{How to call the clonotype - CDR3 gene (gene), CDR3 nucleotide (nt) or CDR3 amino acid (aa), or
CDR3 gene+nucleotide (gene+nt).}

\item{group}{The column header for which you would like to analyze the data.}

\item{exportTable}{Exports a table of the data into the global environment in addition to the visualization}
}
\value{
ggplot of the diversity of clonotype sequences across list
}
\description{
This function calculates traditional measures of diversity - Shannon, inverse Simpson, Chao1 index, and abundance-based
coverage estimators (ACE) by sample or group. The group paramter can be used to condense the individual samples. If a
matrix output for the data is preferred, set exportTable = TRUE.

clonalDiversity(combined, cloneCall = "gene")
