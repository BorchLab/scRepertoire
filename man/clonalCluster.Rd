\usage{
clonalCluster(
  input.data,
  chain = "TRB",
  sequence = "aa",
  threshold = 0.85,
  group.by = NULL,
  cluster.method = "components",
  cluster.prefix = "cluster.",
  use.V = TRUE,
  use.J = FALSE,
  exportAdjMatrix = FALSE,
  exportGraph = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.data}{The product of \code{\link[=combineTCR]{combineTCR()}},
\code{\link[=combineBCR]{combineBCR()}} or \code{\link[=combineExpression]{combineExpression()}}.}

\item{chain}{The TCR/BCR chain to use for clustering. Use "both" to combine
networks from TRA/TRB or IGH/IGL. Valid options: "both", "TRA", "TRB",
"TRD", "TRG", "IGH", "IGK", "IGL".}

\item{sequence}{Clustering based on either \strong{"aa"} or
\strong{"nt"}.}

\item{threshold}{The similarity threshold. If < 1, treated as normalized
similarity (higher is stricter). If >= 1, treated as raw edit distance
(lower is stricter).}

\item{group.by}{The column header used for to group clones.
If (\strong{NULL}), clusters will be calculated across samples.}

\item{cluster.method}{The clustering algorithm to use. Defaults to \code{"components"},
which finds connected subgraphs.}

\item{cluster.prefix}{A character prefix to add to the cluster names (e.g.,
"cluster.").}

\item{use.V}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, sequences must share the same V gene to be
clustered together.}

\item{use.J}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, sequences must share the same J gene to be
clustered together.}

\item{exportAdjMatrix}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function returns a sparse
adjacency matrix (\code{dgCMatrix}) of the network.}

\item{exportGraph}{Return an igraph object of connected
sequences (\strong{TRUE}) or the amended input with a
new cluster-based variable (\strong{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
Depending on the export parameters, one of the following:
\itemize{
\item An amended \code{input.data} object with a new metadata column containing cluster IDs (default).
\item An \code{igraph} object if \code{exportGraph = TRUE}.
\item A sparse \code{dgCMatrix} object if \code{exportAdjMatrix = TRUE}.
}
}
\description{
This function clusters TCRs or BCRs based on the edit distance of their CDR3
sequences. It can operate on either nucleotide ("nt") or amino acid ("aa")
sequences and can optionally enforce that clones share the same V gene.
The output can be the input object with an added metadata column for cluster
IDs, a sparse adjacency matrix, or an \code{igraph} graph object representing the
cluster network.
}
\details{
The clustering process is as follows:
\enumerate{
\item The function retrieves the relevant chain data from the input object.
\item It calculates the edit distance between all sequences within each group
(or across the entire dataset if \code{group.by} is \code{NULL}).
\item An edge list is constructed, connecting sequences that meet the similarity
\code{threshold}.
\item The \code{threshold} parameter behaves differently based on its value:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{threshold} < 1 (e.g., 0.85):} Interpreted as a \emph{normalized} edit
distance or sequence similarity. A higher value means greater
similarity is required. This is the default behavior.
\item \strong{\code{threshold} >= 1 (e.g., 2):} Interpreted as a maximum \emph{raw} edit
distance. A lower value means greater similarity is required.
}
\item An \code{igraph} graph is built from the edge list.
\item A clustering algorithm is run on the graph. The default
\code{cluster.method = "components"} simply identifies the connected
components (i.e., each cluster is a group of sequences connected by
edges). Other methods from \code{igraph} can be used.
\item The resulting cluster information is formatted and returned in the
specified format.
